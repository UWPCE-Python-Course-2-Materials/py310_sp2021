# Test data gen

1. Write a python program that generates test data and stores it in a csv file.
1. The program reads column names, their type and length.
1. It then generates data in as many rows as needed, ensuring that each 
column contains data compliant with the specified length and type. For example, 
a name column that is a 30 character long string must generate strings no 
longer than 30 (but probably at least 5).
1. The data does not have to be valid beyond complying with its length and
type (so a name can be jhiublks uyiy for example).
