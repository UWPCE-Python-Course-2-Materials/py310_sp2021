Using an OO approach:
Think about what classes you may need.

Write a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and
100. The player then tries to guess the number.

The player starts with a score of 100.Every time the player guesses
incorrectly, give a clue, and reduce the score by 10.


When the player guesses correctly, display a message and show the score.
The game finishes. Allow the player to chose to play the game again.

Extra credit

Keep the total score for all games played for the player.
Maintain a highest score ever, by player name.
